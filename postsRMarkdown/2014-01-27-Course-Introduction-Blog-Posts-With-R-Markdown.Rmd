Course Introduction and Blog Posts with R Markdown
========================================================

This course is a follow up to the Software Carpentry R Bootcamp hosted by the US EPA and URI Coastal Institute on Jan 13-15, 2014 at the URI Coastal Institute.  The main idea behind having a separate, semester long course was to provide pariticpants of the bootcamp an opportunity to continue practicing the skills they were introduced to and also delve more deeply into some specific applications of R.  While we intend to have a few classes led by the instructors, our hope is that most of the classes and topics will be chosen, prepared, and presented by the students in the class.  The current list of topics and date of presentation is listed on our [course calendar](http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/calendar.html) 




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r}
plot(cars)
```
