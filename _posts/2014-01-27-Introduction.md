Course Introduction and Blog Posts with R Markdown
========================================================

This course is a follow up to the Software Carpentry R Bootcamp hosted by the US EPA and URI Coastal Institute on Jan 13-15, 2014 at the URI Coastal Institute.  The main idea behind having a separate, semester long course was to provide pariticpants of the bootcamp an opportunity to continue practicing the skills they were introduced to and also delve more deeply into some specific applications of R.  While we intend to have a few classes led by the instructors, our hope is that most of the classes and topics will be chosen, prepared, and presented by the students in the class.  The current list of topics and date of presentation is listed on our [course calendar](http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/calendar.html) 

As we said, most of the course content is to be provided by the course participants. Instead of using traditional means of turning in and presenting this content, we are going to adopt a "practice what we preach" approach.  The rest of this post will layout what is expected in this regard.

### Blogging your homework

The first thing that will be a bit different about this class

### Using Git and Github to turn in assignments

The secon thing we are trying with this course 

### Writing up your work with R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist    
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120
```


You can also embed plots, for example:



```r
plot(cars)
```
